# Do-It

This app is a To-Do list created with third-party database Realm and written in the Swift language.  
It uses Realm to save and persist the data added in the various categories.
UI is enhanced with the Chameleon library.

How to use:
Click the "+" symbol upon opening the app to create a category. Click inside the category to see the list of to-do items.
Click the "+" symbol again inside the category folder to create a to-do item.

The rest of the app should be intuitive to navigate.  Thanks for checking it out!
